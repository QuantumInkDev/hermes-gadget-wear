# Hermes final-delivery context hook

Base: Hermes Agent `e6f57427c198cfd96854522b7a9159eb007e13c2`.

The [patch](0001-feat-preserve-adapter-final-delivery-context.patch) adds generic adapter
final-delivery context hook version 2. It preserves accepted enrollment provenance through
atomic turn markers, queued/redirected terminal identity changes, canonical delivery rows
and recovery. Context-free adapters keep their existing behavior. The Gadget-specific
consumer is SDK patch 4 in the [SDK series](../README.md).

Apply only to a fresh isolated checkout at the pinned commit, checking with `git apply
--check` before `git apply`. This directory is separate from `server/patches`, whose
contents apply to the Gadget SDK. `tools/setup-extensions.py` applies only SDK patches;
it does not patch installed Hermes or enable a live capability.

Do not overwrite unrelated local core changes. The maintainer's runtime compatibility
fixture and its pre-existing modifications remain private; only the clean upstream delta
is exported here. Existing locally modified installations need their own verified patch
application and rollback preparation.

The reviewed implementation has 100 passing warning-strict actual-core checks per clean
and private-runtime fixture, including stock behavior, failed writes, real process restart,
queued/redirected identities and rotated enrollments. This is focused software evidence.
Broader existing core suites have disclosed unclosed SQLite warning debt and are not
claimed green. Fresh exported-patch checks and live rollout are tracked in project progress.

The hook does not rerun model/tool work. A context-bearing interrupted turn without a
canonical final stays held for explicit resolution. Old version-1 adapter contexts are
refused rather than reassigned to a current enrollment. No upstream PR, maintainer
agreement or live deployment is claimed.
